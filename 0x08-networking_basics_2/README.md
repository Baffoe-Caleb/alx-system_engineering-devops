## 0x08. Networking basics #1
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering** studies at **ALX Africa**. It aims to learn about  localhost/127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0, `/etc/hosts` and how to display the machine's active network interfaces. </br> I continued to learn about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
